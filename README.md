## Introduction: Particle Beam Therapy

We all know that radiation can cause cancer, but radiation can also be used to fight cancer. One example of this is particle beam cancer therapy, in which a beam of charged particles (usually protons or pions) is shot into a tumor with the goal of destroying it.
As particles from such a beam travel through the body, they gradually lose energy and eventually come to rest. As it turns out, much of the particle’s energy is lost close to the point at which it stops. This makes such beams well-suited for killing tumors without doing too much damage to the other tissues they pass through on the way to the tumor, or tissues beyond the tumor.
Particles with higher energies will travel farther into the body. By adjusting the energy of the particles, we can cause them to stop at a chosen depth (ideally, inside a tumor).
At moderate energies, a beam of particles traveling through a body loses energy mostly through interactions with electrons. Although it’s possible that some of the particles will bump into an atomic nucleus, that doesn’t happen very often. Since protons are 2,000 times heavier than electrons, beams of these particles tend to travel in a straight line, knocking puny electrons aside as they go.
Figure 3 shows how much energy protons deposit as they travel through the body. The four curves show what happens when you use protons of four different starting energies, ranging from 50 MeV to 125 MeV. The energy deposited damages the body’s tissues. The goal is to destroy the tumor without doing too much damage to healthy tissue.


## The Assignment
Imagine you’re a doctor working at a radiation therapy facility. You have at your command a beam of protons. You can aim the beam precisely, and control its energy.
You’re preparing for a visit by a patient with a 2-centimeter-thick tumor buried 8 centimeters deep in her body (see Figure 4). You need to determine what energy the protons should have in order to deposit most of their energy in the region of the tumor.
A physicist colleague has given you a formula to calculate the energy lost by a particle while going through a thin slice of material. The formula has a form like this1:
∆E = ∆x · f (E, proton properties, material properties)
where ∆E is the amount of energy the particle loses, ∆x is the thickness of the slice, and f is some function that depends on E (the energy at the beginning of the slice) as well as the constant properties of the particle (like charge and mass) and properties of the material (like density).
Unfortunately, your physicist friend tells you that eight centimeters is too big to call a “thin slice”. But that’s OK, she says. Just treat the eight centimeters as though it was a stack of thinner slices, as shown in Figure 5. Each time the proton passes through one of the slices, it loses
